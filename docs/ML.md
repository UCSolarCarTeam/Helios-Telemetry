You can review the ML repository here:

## Main goals of Telemetry ML

- Learn more about the car data through exploratory analysis
- Learn how to optimize the distance of the car through models
- Expose anomalies in the data and understand where they came from
- Explain the car data through graphs, visualizations, and models.

## We are exploring how to do this through tools like

- Graphana
- Plotly
- PyTorch/Tensorflow
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas

## The Telemetry ML team does not solely focus on Machine Learning Models however. There are several considerations that need to be made in the following areas

- Deployment options
- Data Caching
- Infrastructure as Code
- Data Pipelines
- Data Integrity
