# Instructions to test

Ensure you have the protobuf server running on port 8000. You can find additional instructions in the [protobuf server README](https://github.com/UCSolarCarTeam/ML-Telemetry/blob/setup_protobuf/README.md#generate-python-code-from-protobuf)

To run the tests for the shared package, you can use the following command in the root directory of the repository:

```bash
npx tsx ./packages/shared/src/test.ts

```
